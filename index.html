	<h1>Varignon's Theorem</h1>
	
	<p>Varignon's theorem states that if you construct and join the midpoints of consecutive sides in <em>any</em> quadrilateral, then the resulting quadrilateral is a parallelogram. I first learned of this theorem from <cite>Geometry Revisited</cite> by Coxeter and Greitzer. <a href="links.html">You can view some information about other sites related to the theorem.</a></p>

	<p>You can learn about Varignon's theorem at <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/VarignonsTheorem.html">MathWorld</a>. This is a nice site about the theorem because it is simple, clean, and has lots of links to related ideas. It is, however, lacking a proof.</p>
