	<h1>Varignon's Theorem</h1>
	
	<p>Varignon's theorem stats that if you construct and join the midpoints of consecutive sides in <em>any</em> quadrilateral, then the resulting quadrilateral is a parallelogram. I first learned of this theorem from <cite>Geometry Revisited</cite> by Coxeter and Greitzer.</p>
